      "It's tough to describe the impact that MECG has had on my life - the community, mentorship, personal and professional development have all been foundations of my growth in college. During my time in MECG, I got to work not only with products I use every day, but with new, innovative startups across the country. Collaborating on real, impactful projects with driven and brilliant people motivated me to accelerate my learning and continue that same trajectory in a post-grad consulting role. Looking back, I remember the countless laughs, late-night bondings, and all the hard work we put in. The friends and memories made are truly unique and will always make MECG something I am always grateful for!"

      "MECG has seriously meant the world to me! I’ve grown so much — whether it was learning how to network or figuring out how to make an impactful slide deck, I feel more than ready to jump into my full-time consulting job. But honestly, the best part has been the memories I’ve made with my best friends — flag football, retreat, consulting club date parties — it’s been such a fun ride and I’m so grateful for it all!",

      "MECG was more than just a college organization–it’s family. The mentors I gained are still some of the first people I turn to even after graduation, and the friendships I made are lifelong. I credit so much of my personal and professional growth to this community. Working alongside some of the most driven, thoughtful people on campus sharpened my problem-solving and communication skills in ways the classroom never could, and gave me the confidence to navigate complex, ambiguous challenges after college. MECG set the standard for the kind of communities and work cultures I strive to build today.",

      "MECG was one of the most foundational parts of my college experience—from providing me exposure to real companies whose products I actually use, to working with some of the most intelligent people on campus—which made the work feel incredibly meaningful. I learned how technology and business can be used to solve problems in everything from wearable fitness technology, food delivery platforms, major league sports teams, and more. I currently work as a consultant in New York, and I can’t imagine my college experience or transition to a new city without MECG and the lifelong friends I made within it.",

      "MECG has been one of the most meaningful parts of my college journey—equal parts community, challenge, and growth. Working on real client projects with my team gave me the chance to dive deep into product strategy, pitch tangible solutions, and learn what it means to collaborate under pressure. From late-night working sessions to spontaneous team dinners, the experience pushed me far beyond the classroom. I not only gained exposure to real-world problem-solving but also built friendships and memories that made every moment unforgettable. Looking back, it’s clear that the laughs, the hard work, and the incredible people shaped my understanding of product management and inspired me to keep growing.",

MECG provided not only the skills needed to secure my full time job and make a living, but also the support system and friendships to make a life. Whether that’s as a freshman soaking up what it means to be a leader in business and delivering results for our clients, or as a senior giving back and investing in mentorship, the MECG experience was richly impactful and enhanced each aspect of my college journey!",

      "I’m so thankful to have had the MECG community with me during my time in college. Even though I decided to not go into consulting, working directly with a real client, leading a team as a project manager, and learning how to strategically solve business problems, was invaluable in my role as a program manager. I also wouldn’t have known I could go into program management at a tech company if it wasn’t for an MECG alumni who taught me all about it. I can say without a doubt that I would not be where I am today personally or professionally without the wonderful people of MECG Consulting Group."
